        "BFS\tShortest/Optimal in terms of number of steps (edges).\tFinds the path with the minimum number of pours/fills/empties.\n",
        "DFS\tCan be long and sub-optimal. Finds the first path it encounters by diving deep.\tMight explore a very long sequence of steps that is not the most direct route to the target.\n",

        "In the Water Jug Problem, where every step (fill, empty, pour) has a uniform cost (cost = 1), the path found by BFS and A* (using a simple admissible heuristic like h(n)=0 or h(n)=target amount−current max amount) will be the same shortest path. DFS, however, is prone to finding a much longer, non-optimal path because it explores deeply before backtracking.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Which Algorithm Gives the Shortest Path? Why?\n",
        "The algorithms that guarantee the shortest path for the Water Jug Problem are BFS and A* Search (assuming a non-misleading, admissible heuristic).\n",

        "Breadth-First Search (BFS):\n",
        "\n",
        "Why: BFS explores all nodes at a given depth level before moving to the next level. Since every step (edge) has the same cost (1), the first time it reaches the goal state, it must be via the path with the fewest steps. It is complete and optimal for unweighted graphs (uniform step costs).\n",

        "A* Search:\n",

        "Why: A* uses the evaluation function f(n)=g(n)+h(n), where g(n) is the actual path cost from the start (number of steps) and h(n) is the estimated cost to the goal (heuristic). When the heuristic h(n) is admissible (never overestimates the cost) and the step cost is uniform, A* is also optimal and finds the shortest path.\n",
